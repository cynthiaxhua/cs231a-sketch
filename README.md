CS231A Project (Gary Yu, Cynthia Hua, Jeff Hara)

## progress (2/24/18)
http://stanford.edu/~jhara18/index.html
* for now, I'm serving up a few .svg files and you can see how we can dynamically load SVG images and use JS and CSS to manipulate them.

## todo (2/24/18)
1. Set up Mechanical Turk
  * Decide where we want to serve files? I don't actually know how MT works.
  * Decide format / design of survey
2. Set up CNN and harness
  * will post code I have (jeff)
3. Decide on animation
  * need to figure this out or we can't proceed with CNN
4. Resolve issues with Vectorization of Bitmap
  * is it possible to train neural net to do this? we probably have enough data
