* for now, I'm serving up a few .svg files and you can see how we can dynamically load SVG images and use JS and CSS to manipulate them.

## progress (2/25/18)
https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-website-sketchdata-zhrth/index.html
* I'm hosting the survey website on AWS (free up to 5GB)
* We can make changes to the directory aws/ and I can upload them as a .zip file or manage files individually so we can develop the survey collectively.

## todo (2/24/18)
1. Set up Mechanical Turk
  * ~Decide where we want to serve files? I don't actually know how MT works.~
  * Decide format / design of survey
2. Set up CNN and harness
  * will post code I have (jeff)
3. Decide on animation
  * need to figure this out or we can't proceed with CNN
4. Resolve issues with Vectorization of Bitmap
  * is it possible to train neural net to do this? we probably have enough data

### survey todo (2/26/18)
